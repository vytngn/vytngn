# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vy, a student at Rutgers majoring in IT and minoring in CS. Welcome to my Github page!

### About Me
I have a passion for both front-end and back-end development, but I lean more towards front-end due to the visual aspect. I am constantly learning and challenging myself to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

### Skills

- JavaScript
- SQL
- Java
- Git
### Contact Me
I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tvy-nguyen/).
